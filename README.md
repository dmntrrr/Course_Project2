In the PNG files you can find graphs, which will help you to answer following questions accordingly:

1) Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?

3) Which of the four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?

4) Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

5) How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

6) Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California. Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

Along with PNG files you can find .R files with code for creating these graphs.
